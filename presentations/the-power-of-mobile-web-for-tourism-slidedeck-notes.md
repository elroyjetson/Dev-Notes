* Check your analytics
    * Which devices access your site most often
    * What pages or sections are most popular
* Test most critical and commonly accessed content using devices discovered in step 1
* Test all partner services
* Be pragmatic
    * Take advantage of services already well optimized: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, SlideShare etc.
    * 'Well Optimized' - lightweight, mobile friendly layout, **site-to-site URL integrity**, support for most modern smartphones
* Lighten up!
    * Reduce page weight
* Enhance where you can
* **Check your URL's**
    * ensure users who email, tweet or link to content can access that URL from any device
    * implement friendly error page for equivalent content that doesn't exist

* Think of the user journey
* Start simple and experiment
